# M18-Social-Api

## Purpose
Create a NoSQL based backend for a social based api that handles Users, Thoughts, and a friends list for each user as well as Reactions for each Thought. This was done using MongoDB and Mongoose to handle the api interaction with the database.

## Built With
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* NodeJS
* Express

## Contents
Server.js file and package.json on the top layer along with the folders. There is a model folder to hold the models/schemas, a routes folder to handle api routing through express, a controllers folder that has the actual fetch requests, and a utils folder that has the formatDate getter stored in it. All of the folders besides the utils folder contain index.js files to help better organize the content within.
